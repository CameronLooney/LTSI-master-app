# LTSI Automation Tool

---
## Description
- The motivation behind this tool was to find an easy to use solution to a highly manual task. 
- I built this tool to automate the task and thus improve team efficiency, accuracy and overall output. 
- By creating this tool I hope to save the team between 8-10 hours per week. 
- I learned a great deal about data manipulation in pandas and about deploying a project for others to use.
